# Sudoku Solver
## What is the project?
The Sudoku Solver is a c++ program that allows the user to enter a sudoku image and the program gives in output the solution. The program uses OpenCV for the image
processing and Tesseract for numbers recognition.

### Input:
![sudoku2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93351393/211330981-d95aa652-090a-456e-b4c5-bc9a2e0c4939.png)
### Output:
![sudoku_image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93351393/211331298-118b821e-22b7-4d52-b20b-105d9960af4d.png)

### You can see a demo of this program in this youtube video:

## What does the program do?
The program takes a sudoku image in parameters, process it to reduce noises and threshold it. The program searches for the grid and crops if needed, it searches all squares. The squares are given to tesseract to recognize numbers. After all of that, the resolution is ready and the program uses backtracking to solve it.
It takes an average of 4 seconds.

## How do I use it?
To use it, you just have to download the zip file, build the program in your favorite IDE and run it. If you run from the console you just have to put as first 
argument the sudoku image path. If you run it in the ide, you have to comment or delete the 
```
if (argc != 2)
	{
		std::cout << "Enter one sudoku image\n";
		std::cin.get();
		return -1;
	}
 ```
 and remplace the path_image by the sudoku image path.
 
 ## Does it work every time?
 For the moment the sudoku solver has few problems for this part. If the image is clean, big, with no contrast of color it will work.
 But the numbers recognition can fail. That's why I add a manual function that allows the user to enter the differents numbers.
